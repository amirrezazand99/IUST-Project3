below you can see our first page, as you can see there are number of records which have been grabed so far
just in the middle of the main page you should make a decision whether you want to see cell variation or others

If you choose Cell and press Show map you can see the cells which we were connected to it (In "Hemmat Express way")

If you choose "Generation" you are able to see the changes in term of mobile network generation ("4g", "3G", "2G")

If you choose "TAC" you are get to see how many times we were connected to different TACs
In the following screen shot you can see **if we connect to TAC No.1 then we connect to TAC No.2 the color will change and if we connect to TAC No.1 again the color is the same as it was**

If you choose "PLMN" you can see the PLMNs changes in our way
**Attention please** In general PLMN should not change in way but in our project we did switch PLMN in the middle of our way to show its functionality
